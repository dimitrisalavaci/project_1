# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals

- Complete the assignemnt to the best of my ability with as much organized detail as possible, while understanding everything I'm doing

## Process:

1. Loading csv files into database
2. Data cleaning
3. Questions
4. Data
5. QA your data
6. Generate ERD 


## Results

- Discovered that Americans love ballpoint pens
- I was able the sum of certain columns as well as the average which helped me answer the questions that were being asked
- Majority of this company's business comes from the United Staes, but also gets business from places all around the world
- a bunch of their products are made for people that I would say are at home/in the office majority of the time
- they have a wide variety of products but it seems people tend to buy their most popular items the most and rest not so much

## Challenges 

- While I was importing the data, (creating tables and adding all the data in them) I was having difficulties with the data as I kept getting an error message saying that I wasn't able to import that the data into the tables because I had a data type of integer but that specific column had "notnull" in it so I was stuck there for a while until I changed
  everything to varchar. Once I did that however, I had to figure out how to apply addition/division syntax to a varchar data type and get a result which also took a while to figure out, but I managed in the end.
- Another issue I had was applying a primary key to 1 or 2 of the tables, kept getting error message saying cannot complete because pkey value already exists and is a duplicate.

## Future Goals

- I would look into quality assurance a lot more, unfortunately didn't have as much time as I wanted to go over this portion of the assignment, so if I had another chance I would definitely try and get some more info on quality assurance.
